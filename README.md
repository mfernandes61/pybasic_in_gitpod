If you wish to run the course on your personal computer, here are the steps to follow to get up and running.

## Clone this github project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pycam/python-intro.git
cd python-intro
```

## Dependencies

Install Python 3 by downloading the latest version from https://www.python.org/.

Python 2.x is legacy, Python 3.x is the present and future of the language.

Create first a virtual environment using the [`venv` library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). Update pip if needed, install [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) and [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) to get a slideshow extension into jupyter.

***Note*** A virtual environment is a Python environment such that the Python interpreter, libraries and scripts installed into it are isolated from those installed in other virtual environments.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
# activate your virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
# update pip if needed
pip install --upgrade pip
# install jupyter
pip install jupyter

# slideshow extension
pip install rise
jupyter-nbextension install rise --py --sys-prefix
jupyter nbextension enable rise --py --sys-prefix
```

## Usage

Go to the directory where you've cloned this repository, activate your virtual environment and run jupyter.

Your web browser should automatically open with this url http://localhost:8888/tree where you see the directory tree of the course with all the jupyter notebooks.

```bash
cd python-basic
source venv/bin/activate
jupyter notebook
```

To shutdown jupyter, type ctrl-C into the terminal you've ran `jupyter notebook`, answer `y` and press `enter`.

You may wish to deactivate the virtual environment, by entering into the terminal:
```
deactivate
```
